Automating User Management Script for Ubuntu Server

## Program Description

This Python script automates the process of creating multiple users and assigning them to specified groups on an Ubuntu system. By using a provided input file, the script reads user data (username, password, full name, and groups) and executes commands to add the users, set their passwords, and assign them to the respective groups. This automation reduces administrative overhead, especially when managing a large number of users on multiple servers.<
